 <p>Guitars come in two main types: electric and acoustic.</p> 
 <h2>Acoustic Guitars</h2> 
 <p>Acoustic guitars have a large hollow body that projects the sound of the 
 strings.</p> 
 <h3>Nylon String Acoustic Guitars</h3> 
 <p>Descendants of the gut-strung instruments of yore, nylon string guitars 
 have a mellow tone.</p> 
 <h3>Steel String Acoustic Guitars</h3> 
 <p>Steel string guitars first appeared in country music and today most acoustic 
 guitars have steel strings.</p> 
 <h2>Electric Guitars</h2> 
 <p>Electric guitars have a solid or hollow body with pickups that capture 
 the string vibration so it can be amplified.</p> 
 <h3>Solid Body Electric Guitars</h3> 
 <p>Solid body electric guitars are commonly used in rock and country music.</p> 
 <h3>Hollow Body Electric Guitars</h3> 
 <p>Hollow body acoustic guitars are commonly used in blues and jazz.</p>
